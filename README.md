The name of this project/bot is inspired by the C/C++ language. Now, you might be wondering: why wasn't this project in C/C++? Well, glad you asked. The reason is that Python is easier to learn and use for a novice like myself. In hindsight, CPython is built on top of C. So yeah, I can _C_ the relation between this name and Python :)</sub>
